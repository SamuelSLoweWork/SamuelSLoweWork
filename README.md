- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SamuelSLoweWork.
 Currently pursuing my Google Cybersecurity Certificate, I am deeply passionate about protecting digital assets and ensuring the security of information in an increasingly connected world. Through this program, Iâ€™m mastering key technical competencies, including network security, threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability assessment. Iâ€™m excited about applying these skills to real-world challenges, where I can contribute to creating safer digital environments.
My career path has been shaped by diverse experiences, from owning and managing a successful business to working in customer service and hospitality. As the owner of Emerald Vapors, I was responsible for troubleshooting technical issues and protecting sensitive customer information, which strengthened my problem-solving abilities and adaptability. My time as a chef at the University of Michigan developed my attention to detail and ability to make critical decisions under pressureâ€”skills that are highly transferable to cybersecurity.
 What sets me apart is my ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences. Managing retail teams and interacting with customers has honed my leadership and interpersonal skills, which I leverage to bridge the gap between complex technical issues and clear, actionable solutions. Iâ€™m excited to apply my technical knowledge and diverse skill set to a cybersecurity help desk role, where I can help protect businesses from evolving security threats.
